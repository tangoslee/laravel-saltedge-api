}
```

`composer update` or `composer install`.

## Configuration

In laravel's .env file add following keys with proper values Which you can attain from [SaltEdge](https://www.saltedge.com/client_users/sign_up), e.g.:

```$json
SALTEDGE_URL=

```

## What's included

The package provides 4 new services that fetch data from SaltEdge's API:

* `AccountService` that provides integration with selected [accounts endpoints](https://docs.saltedge.com/reference/#accounts) of the API
* `CategoryService` that provides integration with selected [categories endpoint](https://docs.saltedge.com/reference/#categories) of the API
* `CustomerService` that provides integration with selected [customers endpoint](https://docs.saltedge.com/reference/#customers) of the API
* `ProviderService` that provides integration with selected [providers endpoint](https://docs.saltedge.com/reference/#providers) of the API

The package registers its own `SaltEdgeServiceProvider`, so all the above services will be available right after installing the composer package.
